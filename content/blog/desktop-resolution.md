In todayʼs broad landscape of monitor configurations, itʼs easy to get lost trying to determine what to officially support when building an application. The first and most important step in determining what to support is to know your audience. You should be able to generalize on what _type_ of user-facing application you are developing. For desktop's, these fall into one of two main categories: <u>niche</u> and <u>common</u> applications.

Niche applications have specialized requirements and usually need to be categorized further. They represent the extremes when determining required screen size to perform a task. Software like high resolution imaging, studio recording, and gaming would be on one extreme while HMI's for control systems and keosk applications are on the other.

Common applications -- which include word processing, data analysis, communication, and design tools -- are the workhorses of the modern job. They constitute the majority of software that developers create and that employees rely on. While factors like productivity and corporate budgets often determine equipment choices, the problem persists: how to accurately assess the constraints placed on common application design.

## Most Efficient Size



ultrawide vs dual setup and how ultrawide can be partitioned into two or three smaller screens (for size consideration. Look at samsung article on this one)

## Accounting for Scale Factor
