## About Me
Born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, I carry the hands-on work ethic that shaped my city. I take a strong do-it-yourself approach to solving problems and learning new skills. Making things -- whether through building and fabrication, mechanical tinkering, embedded systems, software development, or full-fledged product design -- is my creative outlet. If something sparks my curiosity, I’ll find a way to learn it and put it into practice.

When I’m not working my day job or immersed in building something, I recharge by spending time outdoors -- traveling, rock climbing, and mountain biking with my wife and friends. These aren’t just hobbies; they’re how I explore new places and gain perspective. Great summits and scenic trails off the beaten path often lead me to corners of the world I might never have discovered otherwise.

## Why a Website
We spend almost a third of our working lives with our colleagues, often on long-standing projects where planning, technical decisions, debt prioritization, and documentation quality can make all the difference in how manageable a product is. Traditional resumes, CVs, and interviews can feel impersonal, often focusing on solving on-the-spot puzzles; missing how someone actually prioritizes real work or what they’re like to collaborate with. _Matty Kakes Makes_ is a glimpse into how I approach work, a showcase of my creative projects, and a peek at my personality through off-topic blogs and tangents.

In doing so I want to highlight the biggest trend in my work experience -- adapting to change. Every job, project, and undertaking has required me to develop a new set of skills. I approach work by taking ownership seriously and understanding project needs through requirement-driven design. Focusing heavily on close collaboration with others to manage and prioritize tasks while quickly picking up the tools and technologies needed to deliver quality products. I believe the technology we choose should always serve the project’s requirements, not personal preference.

I’ve built greenfield products, expanded and maintained legacy systems, and worked across multiple industries. These experiences have given me confidence in navigating complex challenges and delivering solutions that are both robust and user-focused.
